# Sorry
For 2 to 4 players

## Object
To be the first player to get all four of your pawns from your color START to your color HOME

## Equipment
Sorry Game Board, Deck of Cards (no 6’s or 9’s), 16 pawns (4 each of 4 colors)

## Setup
- Choose four pawns of the same color. Put all four on that color START space.
- Shuffle the deck. Place face down.
- Pick a player to go first. Movement is clockwise around the board (unless instructed otherwise!) and play passes to the left.

## Game Play
**Note:** If it’s your first turn and you do not draw a card that lets you start a pawn out, you forfeit your turn.
- On all turns, take the top card on the Draw pile and move accordingly if you can. Place the card face up in the discard pile.
- To Start a Pawn: To move a pawn from your START out onto the track, you must draw either a 1 or a 2. If it is a 2, do as it says, then draw again and move if possible. You  may not start a pawn with any other cards!
### Jumping and Bumping
You may jump over your own or another player’s pawn that’s in your way, counting it as one space, BUT… if you land on a space that’s already occupied by an opponent’s pawn, BUMP that pawn back to its own color START space.
### Moving Backwards
4 and 10 cards move you backwards. If you have successfully moved a pawn backwards at least 2 spaces beyond your own START space, you may, on a subsequent turn, move into your own SAFETY ZONE without moving all the way around the board.
### Notes
- Two pawns of the same color may never occupy the same space. If your only possible move would make you land on a space already occupied by another of your own pawns, you forfeit your turn.
- If at any time you cannot move, you forfeit your turn.
- But if at any time you can move, you must move, even if it’s to your disadvantage.
- If you run out of cards in the Draw pile, shuffle the Discards and use them.

## WINNING
If you get all four of your pawns to HOME first, you win! If you play again, the winner goes first.

## THE BOARD
**Home:** You must bring all four of your pawns into HOME by exact count!
Once HOME, do not move that pawn again for the rest of the game.

**Slide:** Regardless which card sent you there, any time you land by exact count on the triangle at the beginning of a SLIDE that is not your own color, slide ahead to the end and BUMP any
pawns in vour wayincluaing your own.
back to their own START spaces. If you land on a SLIDE of your own color, don't slide, just stay put on the triangle.

**Safety Zone:** Only you may enter your own color SAFETY ZONE. All other rules apply. No pawn may enter its SAFETY ZONE by a backward move; however, a pawn may move backward out of its SAFETY ZONE and on subsequent turns move back into the ZONE as

**Start a Pawn Here:** If you've drawn a 1 card, take a pawn from START and put it onto this circle; your turn ends. If you draw a 2, move a pawn out AND draw again! You may not have two pawns on an entry circle at the same time. If another player's pawn is on your entry circle, BUMP it back to its own START.

## THE CARDS
1. Either start a pawn out OR move one pawn forward 1 space.
2. Either start a pawn out OR move one pawn forward 2 spaces. Whichever you do—or even if you couldn't move-DRAW AGAIN and move accordingly.
3. Move one pawn forward 3 spaces.
4. Move one pawn backwards 4 spaces.
5. Move one pawn forward 5 spaces.
6. **No six card [update]**
7. Either move one pawn forward 7 spaces-OR split the forward move between any two pawns **Notes:**
    - You may not use 7 to start a pawn.
    - If you use part of the 7 to get a pawn HOME, you must be able to use the
balance of the move for another pawn.

8. Move one pawn forward 8 spaces.
9. **No nine card [update]**
10. Either move one pawn forward 10 spaces-OR move one pawn backwards 1 space.
11. ﻿﻿﻿Move one pawn forward 11 spaces-OR switch any one of your pawns with one of any opponent's. **Notes:**
    - You may forfeit your move if you do not wish to change places and it is impossible to go forward 11 spaces.
    - You may only use 11 for pawns in play on the open track—not at START, HOME or in a SAFETY ZONE.
    - If your switch landed you on a triangle at the beginning of another player's slide, slide to the end!

12. Move one pawn forward 12 spaces.

**SORRY!** Take one pawn from your START, place it on any space that is occupied by any opponent, and bump that opponent's pawn back to its START. If there is no pawn on your START or no opponent's pawn on any space you can move to, you forfeit your move.
